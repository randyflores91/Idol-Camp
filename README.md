# Idol-Camp

Idol Camp a fun, funky, rhythm based, 2D game inspired by Nintendo's Rhythm Heaven. This game consists of 5 fun unique levels 
that are each a separate mini game based on music and rhythm. The goal is to help 5 animal trainees practice their different 
skills to become a top idol. The first four levels will test different skill sets, such as keeping beat, memorization, dance 
and singing. It leads to finale fifth level that puts all four previous games into one mashup. The player will not know if they
are winning or losing until the end of the round. 

"Catch the Beat" will give the player an 8-count beat and a goal beat (e.g. beat 16 or 32) and the player must then lock in 
when the goal beat is reached.

"Three Six Nine" has the player face three computer players in taking turns counting but hitting a different key when their 
number contains a 3,6, or 9 digit.

"Dodge Dodge Revolution" has their player dancing between 5 lanes with blocks falling from above trying to ruin the party.

"Pop Idol Music" is similar to guitar hero, in which the player uses the arrow keys to hit incoming notes to the rhythm of the
song.

"Idol Camp Musical" is the final mashup that puts the four levels to the beat of 1 song.

Each level is designed with simple controls like either using the space bar and arrow keys. A tutorial is provided for each 
game along with a Winning and Losing Scene. Each scene is created on Canvases with either an image or movie background and 
colorful animated sprites layered over them. All backgrounds, sprites, and music was found online for free downloads.


EXTENDED DESCRIPTION: All games except for Level 2 (“Three Six Nine”) require a beat timer
which is basically a timer that tells how many beats per seconds (60 secs / BPM). This timer is
synced with the song playing in the background based on the songs BPM. Several other
components are also synced to the song beats or lyrics such as lights that turn on during the
beats, falling blocks, the incoming notes of “Pop Idol Music,” and everything from “Idol Camp
Musical.” When each component was created, a float variable was filled with the beat value in
which it occurred so I can later place them in the correct location for them to appear “on beat.”
